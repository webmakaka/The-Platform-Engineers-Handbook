# Chapter 4: Embedding Observability - Code Examples

## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive, production-ready examples for implementing observability in platform engineering using OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, Grafana, and Jaeger. The code demonstrates the three pillars of observability (metrics, logs, traces), integrates with the OTEL Collector, and shows how to build persona-specific dashboards and observability-driven deployment practices.

**Key Concepts Covered:**
- OpenTelemetry standardization and vendor independence
- Pull-based metrics collection (Prometheus)
- Push-based trace collection (OTLP/Jaeger)
- Single Pane of Glass (SPOG) architecture for observability
- Observability-Driven Development (ODD)
- Persona-specific dashboards (Developer, SRE, Management, Security)
- Observability-driven deployment gates
- Alert rules based on observability data

- Exporting vulnerability counts per severity to Prometheus
- Robust error handling for subprocess, timeout, and JSON parse failures
- Iterating all Trivy `Results` targets (OS packages, language dependencies, etc.)
- Structured metric labeling (`image`, `severity`) for Grafana Security dashboard

**Key Functions:**
- `scan_image_and_export_metrics(image_name)` — Runs `trivy image --format json` against the named image, parses every target in the `Results` array, and sets a `image_vulnerabilities_by_severity` Gauge for each severity level (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW). Errors (scan failure, timeout, bad JSON) are logged and the function returns early rather than raising, so a batch scan continues uninterrupted.

**Prometheus Metric:**
- `image_vulnerabilities_by_severity` — Gauge with labels `image` and `severity`; consumed by the Security persona dashboard and the `CVEDetected` alert rule in `alert-rules.yaml`

**Usage:**
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install prometheus-client
brew install trivy          # macOS; see https://trivy.dev for Linux/Windows

# Run a scan (edit the images list in __main__ as needed)
python cve-scanner.py
```

**Related Chapter Content:**
- Pairs with the `CVEDetected` alert in `alert-rules.yaml` and the Security persona panel in `observability-personas.py`
- Shows how platform teams surface supply-chain risk as a first-class observability signal

```

---

## Step-by-Step Instructions

This section provides detailed instructions for running each component in the recommended order.

### Phase 0: Deploy Monitoring Stack (Prometheus + Grafana)

The observability stack requires Prometheus and Grafana running in-cluster. Deploy them first if not already installed:

```bash
# Deploy kube-prometheus-stack (Prometheus + Grafana + Alertmanager)
helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update
helm install monitoring prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack \
  --namespace monitoring --create-namespace

# Wait for pods to be ready (1-2 minutes)
kubectl get pods -n monitoring

# Port-forward Prometheus and Grafana for local access
kubectl port-forward -n monitoring svc/prometheus-operated 9090:9090 &
kubectl port-forward -n monitoring svc/monitoring-grafana 3000:80 &

# Retrieve the Grafana admin password
kubectl get secret monitoring-grafana -n monitoring -o jsonpath='{.data.admin-password}' | base64 -d; echo
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and log in with username `admin` and the password from the command above.

> **Note:** If the monitoring stack is already installed (e.g., from Chapter 2 via Flux), the `helm install` command will error with "cannot re-use a name that is still in use" — that's fine, it means the stack is already running. If you've recreated your Kind cluster (e.g., after a Docker restart), you will need to redeploy — see the main [README](../../README.md#surviving-docker--kind-restarts) for details.

**Expected Output:**
```
NAME                                                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
alertmanager-monitoring-kube-prometheus-alertmanager-0    2/2     Running   0          2m
monitoring-grafana-xxxxx                                 3/3     Running   0          2m
monitoring-kube-prometheus-operator-xxxxx                 1/1     Running   0          2m
monitoring-kube-state-metrics-xxxxx                       1/1     Running   0          2m
prometheus-monitoring-kube-prometheus-prometheus-0         2/2     Running   0          2m
```

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup (Kubernetes)

If running on Kubernetes, deploy the OTEL Collector first:

> **Note:** The deployment uses `otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:0.98.0`. The config uses the `debug` exporter (replaces the deprecated `logging` exporter) and `otlp/jaeger` (replaces the removed native `jaeger` exporter — Jaeger now accepts OTLP natively on port 4317).

```bash
# Create observability namespace and deploy OTEL Collector
kubectl apply -f otel-collector-deployment.yaml

# Wait for DaemonSet to be ready (readiness probe has a 30s initial delay)
kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod \
  -l app=otel-collector \
  -n observability \
  --timeout=300s

# Verify deployment
kubectl get pods -n observability
kubectl logs -l app=otel-collector -n observability

# Port-forward the OTel Collector so locally-run apps can export traces
# Without this, apps running on your machine cannot reach the collector
# inside the Kind cluster and you will see "Failed to export traces to
# localhost:4317, error code: StatusCode.UNAVAILABLE" errors.
kubectl port-forward -n observability svc/otel-collector 4317:4317 &
```

**Expected Output:**
```
NAME                             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
otel-collector-xxxxx             1/1     Running   0          2m
otel-collector-xxxxx             1/1     Running   0          2m
```

### Phase 2: Local Development Setup (Non-Kubernetes)

For local development without Kubernetes:

```bash
# 1. Start OTEL Collector in Docker
docker run -d \
  --name otel-collector \
  -v $(pwd)/otel-collector-config.yaml:/etc/otel/config.yaml \
  -p 4317:4317 \
  -p 4318:4318 \
  -p 8889:8889 \
  otel/opentelemetry-collector-k8s:0.88.0 \
  --config=/etc/otel/config.yaml

# 2. Verify collector is running
docker logs otel-collector
curl http://localhost:13133/  # Health check endpoint
```

**Expected Output:**
```
{"status":"Server started"}
```

### Phase 3: Validate Observability Stack

Run the test suite to validate configuration:

```bash
# Run all tests
python3 test-observability.py -v

# Expected output:
# test_collector_config_exists ... ok
# test_collector_deployment_exists ... ok
# test_collector_has_all_pipelines ... ok
# test_dashboard_is_valid_json ... ok
# test_dashboard_has_panels ... ok
# test_alert_rules_exist ... ok
# test_alert_rules_have_severity ... ok
# test_app_is_valid_python ... ok
#
# Ran 8 tests in 0.234s
# OK
```

### Phase 4: Run Instrumented Application

Start the example application with OTEL instrumentation:

```bash
# Set environment for OTEL Collector
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="localhost:4317"
export SERVICE_NAME="example-app"

# Install dependencies (if not already installed)
pip install opentelemetry-api opentelemetry-sdk opentelemetry-exporter-otlp

# Run the application
python3 instrument-app.py

# Expected output:
# 2025-02-21 14:23:45 - platform-app - INFO -
# {"timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:23:45.123456",
#  "level": "INFO",
#  "message": "Starting instrumented application",
#  "context": {"otel_enabled": true}}
# 2025-02-21 14:23:45 - platform-app - INFO -
# {"timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:23:45.234567",
#  "level": "INFO",
#  "message": "Server listening on http://0.0.0.0:8000"}
```

**Test the application (in a new terminal):**

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Simulate requests with different latencies
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/data?delay=0.1"
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/data?delay=0.5"

# View metrics
curl http://localhost:8000/metrics

# Trigger an error for trace testing
curl http://localhost:8000/error
```

### Phase 5: Run Metrics Pull Example

In another terminal, run the Flask-based metrics example:

```bash
# Install Flask and prometheus_client
pip install flask prometheus-client

# Run the application
python3 metrics_pull.py

# Expected output:
# WARNING in app.run - Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000
# Press CTRL+C to quit
```

**Test the metrics endpoint:**

```bash
# Generate requests
curl http://localhost:5000/health
curl http://localhost:5000/api/items

# View metrics in Prometheus format
curl http://localhost:5000/metrics
```

**Expected Prometheus metrics output:**
```
# HELP http_requests_total Total HTTP requests
# TYPE http_requests_total counter
http_requests_total{method="GET",endpoint="health",status="200"} 1.0

# HELP http_request_duration_seconds HTTP request duration in seconds
# TYPE http_request_duration_seconds histogram
http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{method="GET",endpoint="health",le="0.005"} 1.0
http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{method="GET",endpoint="health",le="0.01"} 1.0
...
```

### Phase 6: Run Traces Push Example

In another terminal, run the trace collection example:

```bash
# Run the traces example
python3 traces_push.py

# Expected output:
# 2025-02-21 14:25:30,123 - root - INFO - Request result:
# {'success': True, 'result': {'action': 'update', 'status': 'completed', 'duration_ms': 101.23}}
```

**Check OTEL Collector logs for trace receipt:**

```bash
# View collector logs (if running in Kubernetes)
kubectl logs -l app=otel-collector -n observability

# Or for Docker:
docker logs otel-collector | grep "span"
```

**Expected output:**
```
otel_collector: ResourceSpans#0
otel_collector: InstrumentationLibrarySpans#0
otel_collector: Span#0
  Trace ID: 4bf92f3577b34da6a3ce929d0e0e4736
  Parent ID:
  ID: 7a5ece4ef8e9f5f9
  Name: process_user_request
  ...
```

### Phase 7: Generate Persona Dashboards

Create Grafana dashboards for different stakeholders:

```bash
# Generate all persona dashboards
python3 observability-personas.py --output-dir ./dashboards

# Expected output:
# Generated: ./dashboards/dashboard-developer.json
# Prometheus data source: Developer Dashboard - Application Metrics
#   - Persona: developer
#   - Tags: developer, application, debug
#   - Panels: 6
#
# Generated: ./dashboards/dashboard-sre.json
# Prometheus data source: SRE Dashboard - Platform Health
#   - Persona: sre
#   - Tags: sre, infrastructure, reliability
#   - Panels: 6
# ...

# Verify generated files
ls -lh ./dashboards/
```

**Generate a specific persona dashboard:**

```bash
# Developer dashboard
python3 observability-personas.py --persona developer --output-dir ./dashboards

# Or print to stdout
python3 observability-personas.py --persona security --print | jq '.title'
# Output: "Security Dashboard - CVE & Compliance"
```

### Phase 8: Import Dashboards into Grafana

Configure Grafana with the dashboards and alerts:

```bash
# Open Grafana UI (default: http://localhost:3000)
# Default credentials: admin / admin

# Via Grafana UI:
# 1. Navigate to: Dashboards → New → Import
# 2. Click "Upload JSON file"
# 3. Select each file from ./dashboards/ directory
# 4. Choose Prometheus datasource
# 5. Import

# Via Grafana API (if automation is desired):
for dashboard in ./dashboards/*.json; do
  curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/dashboards/db \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN" \
    -d @"$dashboard"
done
```

### Phase 9: Configure Alert Rules

Import the alert rules into Prometheus:

```bash
# Copy alert rules to Prometheus config directory
cp alert-rules.yaml /etc/prometheus/rules/

# Reload Prometheus configuration
curl -X POST http://localhost:9090/-/reload

# Or if running in Kubernetes:
kubectl create configmap prometheus-rules \
  --from-file=alert-rules.yaml \
  -n prometheus \
  --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -

# Verify rules are loaded
curl http://localhost:9090/api/v1/rules | jq '.data.groups[0].rules' | head -20
```

### Phase 10: Generate Load for Testing

Create synthetic traffic to test the full observability stack:

```bash
# Simple load generation script
for i in {1..100}; do
  # Normal request
  curl -s "http://localhost:8000/api/data?delay=0.1" > /dev/null

  # Occasional slow request
  if [ $((i % 20)) -eq 0 ]; then
    curl -s "http://localhost:8000/api/data?delay=0.5" > /dev/null
  fi

  # Occasional error
  if [ $((i % 50)) -eq 0 ]; then
    curl -s "http://localhost:8000/error" > /dev/null
  fi

  sleep 0.1
done

echo "Load generation complete"
```

### Phase 11: View Results in Grafana

Navigate to your dashboards and verify data is flowing:

```
1. Open Grafana: http://localhost:3000
2. Go to: Dashboards → Platform Observability Dashboard
3. Verify panels show:
   - Request latency (p50, p95, p99)
   - Error rate trending
   - Pod health status
   - Resource utilization graphs
```

**Debugging Tips:**

If dashboards are empty:
1. Check Prometheus datasource configuration: Settings → Data Sources → Prometheus
2. Test datasource connection
3. Verify metric names match: Go to Explore → Metrics → http_requests_total
4. Check time range (should be "last 6 hours")

### Phase 12: Verify Traces in Jaeger (Optional)

If Jaeger is configured:

```bash
# Open Jaeger UI: http://localhost:16686
# 1. Select service from dropdown: "trace-demo-service"
# 2. Click "Find Traces"
# 3. Verify traces appear with spans:
#    - process_user_request (parent)
#    - validate_user_action (child)
#    - perform_action (child)
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### OTEL Collector Issues

**Problem: Collector not receiving data**

```bash
# Check collector health
curl http://localhost:13133/

# Check collector logs
docker logs otel-collector | grep -i error
kubectl logs -l app=otel-collector -n observability | grep -i error

# Verify application can reach collector
python3 -c "import socket; socket.create_connection(('localhost', 4317), timeout=5)"
```

**Solution:** Verify OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT matches collector location.

### Metrics Not Appearing in Prometheus

**Problem: Metrics endpoint not being scraped**

```bash
# Verify metrics endpoint is accessible
curl http://localhost:8889/metrics

# Check Prometheus targets
curl http://localhost:9090/api/v1/targets | jq '.data.activeTargets[]'

# Look for collector job
curl http://localhost:9090/api/v1/query?query=up | jq '.data.result'
```

**Solution:** Ensure Prometheus is configured to scrape the collector on port 8889.

### Grafana Dashboard Empty

**Problem: Dashboard panels show no data**

```bash
# Test Prometheus directly
curl "http://localhost:9090/api/v1/query?query=http_requests_total"

# Check datasource settings in Grafana
# Settings → Data Sources → Prometheus → Test Data Source

# Verify metric names in dashboard JSON
grep -o '"expr":"[^"]*' ./dashboards/dashboard-*.json
```

**Solution:** Ensure application is generating metrics and Prometheus is scraping them.
