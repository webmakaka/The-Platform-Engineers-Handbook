# Chapter 11: Validating Compliance with Policy-as-Code

**The Platform Engineer's Handbook**

## Chapter Overview

This chapter demonstrates how to implement **Policy-as-Code** using **Open Policy Agent (OPA)** and its Kubernetes admission controller variant, **OPA Gatekeeper**. Rather than treating compliance as a retroactive audit activity, you will learn to enforce policies proactively at the Kubernetes API boundary, catching misconfigurations before they reach production.

### Key Concepts Covered

1. **OPA Gatekeeper** - Kubernetes admission controller for policy enforcement
2. **Rego Policy Language** - Declarative language for expressing compliance policies
3. **ConstraintTemplates & Constraints** - Infrastructure for defining and applying policies
4. **Shift-Left Testing with conftest** - Validate manifests locally before deployment
5. **Compliance Dashboards** - Monitor policy violations and track remediation progress
6. **Balancing Enforcement with Developer Experience** - Gradual rollout strategies

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Phase 1: Deploy OPA Gatekeeper

#### 1.1 Choose Installation Method

**Option A: kubectl (Manual)**
```bash
# Review the manifest
cat gatekeeper-install.yaml | head -50

# Deploy Gatekeeper
kubectl apply -f gatekeeper-install.yaml

# Watch deployment progress
kubectl get pods -n gatekeeper-system -w
kubectl get validatingwebhookconfigurations,mutatingwebhookconfigurations
```

**Option B: Helm (Recommended)**
```bash
# Add Gatekeeper Helm repo
helm repo add gatekeeper https://open-policy-agent.github.io/gatekeeper/charts
helm repo update

# Install Gatekeeper
helm install gatekeeper gatekeeper/gatekeeper -n gatekeeper-system --create-namespace

# Verify installation
helm list -n gatekeeper-system
```

#### 1.2 Verify Gatekeeper Installation

```bash
# Check if Gatekeeper pods are running
kubectl get pods -n gatekeeper-system
# Expected: gatekeeper-audit-*, gatekeeper-controller-manager-*, webhook-* pods in Running state

# Verify webhook configurations
kubectl get validatingwebhookconfigurations | grep gatekeeper
kubectl get mutatingwebhookconfigurations | grep gatekeeper

# Check webhook logs for errors
kubectl logs -n gatekeeper-system deployment/gatekeeper-audit
kubectl logs -n gatekeeper-system deployment/gatekeeper-controller-manager
```

**Expected Output:**
```
NAME                                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
gatekeeper-audit-5d7f4c9d7-x2k8w          1/1     Running   0          2m
gatekeeper-controller-manager-6b8d4-7p9z  1/1     Running   0          2m
gatekeeper-webhook-6b8d4-abc12            1/1     Running   0          2m
```

### Phase 2: Deploy Policies (Audit Mode)

#### 2.1 Deploy Policy Templates & Constraints

```bash
# Deploy all ConstraintTemplates (standalone + policies/)
kubectl apply -f constraint-template.yaml
kubectl apply -f constraint-template-security-baselines.yaml
kubectl apply -f policies/

# Wait for Gatekeeper to register ALL CRDs from ConstraintTemplates
echo 'Waiting for CRDs...'
until kubectl get crd \
  k8sdenyprivilegedcontainers.constraints.gatekeeper.sh \
  k8srequirelabels.constraints.gatekeeper.sh \
  k8srequireresourcelimits.constraints.gatekeeper.sh \
  k8srestrictimageregistries.constraints.gatekeeper.sh \
  k8srequiredresources.constraints.gatekeeper.sh \
  k8ssecuritybaselines.constraints.gatekeeper.sh \
  >/dev/null 2>&1; do sleep 3; done
echo 'All CRDs registered!'

# Verify ConstraintTemplates are created
kubectl get constrainttemplates
# Expected: k8srequiredresources, k8ssecuritybaselines, k8srequireresourcelimits, etc.

# Deploy Constraint instances (reference the CRDs created above)
kubectl apply -f constraints/

# Verify Constraints are instantiated
kubectl get constraints -A
```

**Expected Output:**
```
NAME                                 ENFORCEMENT-ACTION   TOTAL-VIOLATIONS
deny-privileged-containers           dryrun
require-compliance-labels            dryrun               57
require-labels                       dryrun
require-resource-limits              dryrun
require-resources                    dryrun               29
restrict-image-registries            dryrun
```

> **Note:** All constraints use `dryrun` (audit mode) so you can monitor violations without blocking deployments. This is critical — using `deny` enforcement would block Helm installs in later chapters (e.g., OpenCost in Ch12) because third-party charts typically don't include your custom labels. Violation counts appear after Gatekeeper's next audit cycle (typically 60 seconds).

#### 2.2 Check Initial Audit Results

```bash
# View constraint status and violation counts
kubectl describe constraint require-resource-limits

# Get detailed violations
kubectl get constraint require-resource-limits -o jsonpath='{.status.violations}' | jq .

# Count violations by constraint
for constraint in $(kubectl get constraints -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}'); do
  violations=$(kubectl get constraint $constraint -o jsonpath='{.status.totalViolations}')
  echo "$constraint: $violations violations"
done
```

**Expected Output (Audit Mode):**
```
require-resources: 29 violations
require-compliance-labels: 57 violations
```

> **Why so many violations?** Gatekeeper audits all existing resources in non-excluded namespaces. Most system workloads (CoreDNS, local-path-provisioner, Backstage, etc.) lack the required labels and resource annotations. This is expected — the high violation count demonstrates why starting in audit mode (`enforcementAction: dryrun`) is critical before enforcing.

### Phase 3: Shift-Left Testing with conftest

#### 3.1 Install conftest

```bash
# macOS
brew install conftest

# Linux
wget https://github.com/open-policy-agent/conftest/releases/download/v0.46.0/conftest_0.46.0_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz
tar xzf conftest_0.46.0_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz
sudo mv conftest /usr/local/bin/

# Verify installation
conftest --version
# Expected: conftest 0.46.0
```

#### 3.2 Validate Test Manifests

```bash
# Test the provided sample manifests (expect mixed pass/fail results)
conftest test -p conftest-tests/policy.rego conftest-tests/test-manifests.yaml
```

**Expected:** A mix of passes, warnings, and failures. The test manifests contain both compliant and intentionally non-compliant resources:

```
56 tests, 36 passed, 3 warnings, 17 failures, 0 exceptions
```

Failures include missing labels (`team`, `owner`, `cost-center`), missing resource limits, privileged containers, unauthorized registries, and running as root. These are intentional — the test manifests demonstrate what each policy catches. The 36 passing tests confirm that compliant resources are correctly allowed through.

#### 3.3 Test Against Your Own Manifests

```bash
# Create a test deployment manifest
cat > /tmp/my-deployment.yaml << 'EOF'
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app
  labels:
    team: backend
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: api
        image: gcr.io/my-project/api:v1.0
        # Missing resources - should fail conftest
EOF

# Run conftest (will fail)
conftest test -p conftest-tests/policy.rego /tmp/my-deployment.yaml

# Expected: FAIL - Container 'api' missing CPU requests
```

#### 3.4 Fix Violations and Retest

```bash
# Fix the manifest
cat > /tmp/my-deployment-fixed.yaml << 'EOF'
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app
  labels:
    team: backend
    owner: alice@example.com
    cost-center: "1234"
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: api
        image: gcr.io/my-project/api:v1.0
        resources:
          requests:
            cpu: 100m
            memory: 128Mi
          limits:
            cpu: 500m
            memory: 256Mi
        securityContext:
          privileged: false
          runAsNonRoot: true
          allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
EOF

# Retest (will pass)
conftest test -p conftest-tests/policy.rego /tmp/my-deployment-fixed.yaml
# Expected: 2 tests, 2 passed, 0 failed
```

#### 3.5 Use the run-conftest.sh Script

Instead of running conftest manually, use the provided script for consistent validation with summary output:

```bash
# Run against the test manifests
chmod +x run-conftest.sh
./run-conftest.sh conftest-tests/test-manifests.yaml

# Run against the intentionally non-compliant test-pod-violation.yaml
./run-conftest.sh test-pod-violation.yaml
```

**Expected:** Both commands will show `FAILED` in the validation summary. This is correct — the test manifests contain intentional violations to demonstrate the policies. The wrapper script adds colour-coded output and a summary count of passes vs failures, making it easy to use in CI/CD pipelines.

```bash
# Use --strict mode for CI/CD (returns non-zero exit code on any failure)
./run-conftest.sh test-pod-violation.yaml --strict
```

#### 3.6 Test Policy Violations with test-pod-violation.yaml

Use the provided violation manifest to confirm policies catch common mistakes:

```bash
# Review the intentional violations
cat test-pod-violation.yaml

# Run conftest against it — all should fail
conftest test -p conftest-tests/policy.rego test-pod-violation.yaml

# Expected: Multiple failures for missing resources, privileged containers, :latest tags, etc.
```

#### 3.7 Add Pre-Commit Hooks (Optional)

The `.pre-commit-config.yaml` in this directory configures automatic conftest validation before every commit:

```bash
# Install pre-commit framework (if not already installed)
pip3 install pre-commit

# Copy the config to your repo root and install hooks
cp .pre-commit-config.yaml /path/to/your/repo/
cd /path/to/your/repo
pre-commit install

# Run the conftest hook against all Ch11 files
pre-commit run conftest --all-files
```

**Expected:** The conftest hook will show FAIL for files containing intentionally non-compliant manifests (like `test-pod-violation.yaml`). Infrastructure files (ConstraintTemplates, ServiceMonitors) will also fail label checks because they are not Kubernetes Deployments — conftest applies all rules uniformly. This is normal; in a real project you would scope the hook to only validate application manifests.

### Phase 4: Test Policy Enforcement

#### 4.1 Run Integration Tests

```bash
# Run the test-policies.py suite (offline mode - no cluster required)
python3 test-policies.py
```

**Expected:** All 6 tests pass:

```
test_conftest_compliant_passes ... ok
test_compliant_deployment_passes ... ok
test_missing_labels_detected ... ok
test_no_limits_detected ... ok
test_privileged_container_detected ... ok
test_untrusted_registry_detected ... ok
Ran 6 tests in 0.2s — OK
```

The test suite validates that compliant manifests (with labels, resource limits, approved registries, and non-privileged security contexts) pass conftest, while non-compliant manifests are correctly flagged.

#### 4.2 Test Against Live Cluster

```bash
# Run integration tests against your actual Gatekeeper deployment
python3 test-policies.py --live

# This will attempt to create non-compliant resources and verify they're rejected
# Expected: Resources without proper resource limits will be rejected by Gatekeeper
```

#### 4.3 Manually Test Admission Webhook

All constraints ship in `dryrun` mode so they don't block Helm installs in later chapters (e.g., OpenCost in Ch12). To demonstrate live enforcement, temporarily switch one constraint to `deny`:

```bash
# Temporarily enable deny enforcement on require-resources
kubectl patch k8srequiredresources require-resources \
  --type merge -p '{"spec":{"enforcementAction":"deny"}}'

# Non-compliant: no resource limits → DENIED by Gatekeeper
kubectl run test-noncompliant --image=nginx --dry-run=server
```

**Expected:** Gatekeeper denies the request because the pod has no resource limits:

```
Error from server (Forbidden): admission webhook "validation.gatekeeper.sh" denied the request:
[require-resources] Container test-noncompliant is missing resource limits
[require-resources] Container test-noncompliant is missing resource requests
```

```bash
# Compliant: with resource limits → ACCEPTED by Gatekeeper
kubectl run test-compliant --image=nginx --dry-run=server \
  --overrides='{"spec":{"containers":[{"name":"nginx","image":"nginx","resources":{"limits":{"cpu":"100m","memory":"128Mi"},"requests":{"cpu":"50m","memory":"64Mi"}}}]}}'
```

**Expected:** `pod/test-compliant created (server dry run)` — Gatekeeper allows the pod because it has proper resource limits. The `--dry-run=server` flag validates against the admission webhook without actually creating the pod.

```bash
# IMPORTANT: Switch back to dryrun so later chapters are not blocked
kubectl patch k8srequiredresources require-resources \
  --type merge -p '{"spec":{"enforcementAction":"dryrun"}}'
```

### Phase 5: Set Up Compliance Monitoring

#### 5.1 Deploy Prometheus Scrape Configuration

```bash
# Create monitoring namespace (if not exists)
kubectl create namespace monitoring

# Deploy Prometheus ConfigMap for Gatekeeper metrics
kubectl apply -f prometheus-gatekeeper-config.yaml

# Verify ConfigMap
kubectl get configmap -n monitoring prometheus-gatekeeper -o yaml
```

#### 5.2 Deploy Prometheus Operator ServiceMonitor (Optional)

```bash
# If using Prometheus Operator (https://prometheus-operator.dev/)
kubectl apply -f gatekeeper-metrics-servicemonitor.yaml

# Verify ServiceMonitor
kubectl get servicemonitor -n gatekeeper-system

# Verify Service is created
kubectl get svc -n gatekeeper-system | grep gatekeeper
```

#### 5.3 Generate Compliance Reports

```bash
# Run the compliance dashboard generator
python3 compliance-dashboard.py

# Output: JSON report with violations by policy, namespace, severity
# Example output:
# {
#   "summary": {
#     "total_violations": 47,
#     "policies_enforcing": 3,
#     "policies_auditing": 2
#   },
#   "violations_by_policy": {
#     "require-resource-limits": 25,
#     "require-labels": 18,
#     ...
#   }
# }

# Generate markdown report
python3 compliance-dashboard.py --format markdown --output compliance-report.md
cat compliance-report.md
```

#### 5.4 Set Up Grafana Dashboard

```bash
# If Grafana is installed, import the dashboard
# 1. Navigate to Grafana: http://localhost:3000
# 2. Menu > Dashboards > Import
# 3. Upload: grafana-compliance-dashboard.json
# 4. Select Prometheus data source
# 5. Click Import

# Or use curl to import programmatically
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/dashboards/db \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @grafana-compliance-dashboard.json

# Expected: Dashboard "Gatekeeper Compliance" displays:
#   - Total Violations (stat panel with color thresholds)
#   - Violations by Constraint (bar chart)
#   - Violations by Namespace (table)
#   - Compliance Rate (gauge)
```

#### 5.5 Deploy the Custom Gatekeeper Prometheus Exporter (Optional)

For richer metrics beyond what Gatekeeper exposes natively, deploy the custom exporter:

```bash
# Test locally first
pip3 install prometheus_client kubernetes
python3 scripts/gatekeeper_exporter.py --once

# Run the exporter (exposes metrics on :8000/metrics by default)
python3 scripts/gatekeeper_exporter.py --port 8000 --interval 60

# Verify metrics are available
curl http://localhost:8000/metrics | grep gatekeeper_

# Expected: 9 metric families including:
#   gatekeeper_violations_total
#   gatekeeper_violations_by_policy
#   gatekeeper_violations_by_namespace
#   gatekeeper_constraint_count
```

For production, deploy as a Kubernetes Deployment and add a ServiceMonitor pointing to its `/metrics` endpoint.

### Phase 6: Transition from Audit to Enforcement

#### 6.1 Review Audit Results (Week 1-2)

```bash
# Monitor which resources violate policies
python3 compliance-dashboard.py --days 14 > week1-report.json

# Identify most problematic policies
kubectl get constraints -A -o json | \
  jq '.items[] | {name: .metadata.name, violations: .status.totalViolations}' | \
  sort -k2 -rn | head -10
```

#### 6.2 Communicate with Teams

Share compliance reports with application teams:
- Which policies they're violating
- Specific resources requiring remediation
- Remediation guidance (see "Common Tasks" section below)

#### 6.3 Transition Critical Policies to Enforcement

```bash
# After 2-4 weeks of monitoring, transition resource limits policy
kubectl patch constraint require-resource-limits --type merge \
  -p '{"spec":{"enforcementAction":"deny"}}'

# Verify enforcement is active
kubectl get constraint require-resource-limits -o jsonpath='{.spec.enforcementAction}'
# Expected: deny

# Now non-compliant deployments will be rejected
# Try deploying a non-compliant resource
kubectl apply -f /tmp/my-deployment.yaml  # Missing resources
# Expected: admission webhook denial
```

#### 6.4 Gradual Rollout Schedule (Recommended)

```
Week 1-2: All policies in AUDIT MODE
          - Monitor violations
          - Generate compliance reports
          - Communicate with teams

Week 3-4: Transition CRITICAL policies to enforcement
          - require-resource-limits (prevents resource exhaustion)
          - deny-privileged-containers (security critical)
          - Remaining policies stay in audit

Month 2:  Transition remaining policies to enforcement
          - require-labels (operational but not blocking)
          - restrict-image-registries (based on team readiness)
```

## Common Tasks

### View Policy Violations

```bash
# List all constraint violations
kubectl get constraints -A -o json | jq '.items[] | select(.status.totalViolations > 0)'

# Get detailed violation info for a specific constraint
kubectl describe constraint require-resource-limits

# Export violations to file for analysis
kubectl get constraint require-resource-limits -o json | \
  jq '.status.violations' > violations-export.json
```

### Update a Policy

```bash
# Edit policy definition directly
kubectl edit constraint require-resource-limits

# Or apply from file with changes
vim policies/require-resource-limits.yaml
kubectl apply -f policies/require-resource-limits.yaml

# Verify changes
kubectl describe constraint require-resource-limits
```

### Exempt Specific Namespaces

```bash
# Add namespace to exclusion list
kubectl patch constraint require-resource-limits --type merge \
  -p '{"spec":{"match":{"excludedNamespaces":["kube-system","kube-public","legacy-app"]}}}'

# Verify exemption
kubectl get constraint require-resource-limits -o jsonpath='{.spec.match.excludedNamespaces}'
```

### Exempt Specific Users or Service Accounts

```bash
# Exclude system:kube-controller-manager from policies
kubectl patch constraint require-resource-limits --type merge \
  -p '{"spec":{"match":{"excludedUsers":["system:kube-controller-manager","system:kubeadm"]}}}'
```

### Test Manifest Before Deployment

```bash
# Use conftest locally (fastest)
conftest test -p conftest-tests/policy.rego my-deployment.yaml

# Use kubectl dry-run with server-side evaluation (tests actual Gatekeeper)
kubectl apply -f my-deployment.yaml --dry-run=server

# Use kubectl dry-run client-side (syntax check only, no webhook validation)
kubectl apply -f my-deployment.yaml --dry-run=client
```

### Check Policy Test Coverage

```bash
# Run OPA policy unit tests
opa test policies/ -v

# Run all tests including test files ending in _test.rego
opa test policies/require-tests-passed_test.rego -v
```

## Troubleshooting

### Gatekeeper Pods Not Starting

> **Important**: If Gatekeeper was installed via Flux (Chapter 2), pods may be in `flux-system` instead of `gatekeeper-system`. Check both namespaces: `kubectl get pods -A | grep gatekeeper`

```bash
# Check pod events and logs (adjust namespace if using flux-system)
kubectl describe pod -n gatekeeper-system \
  -l control-plane=controller-manager

# View controller manager logs
kubectl logs -n gatekeeper-system deployment/gatekeeper-controller-manager --tail=50

# Check webhook certificate
kubectl get secret -n gatekeeper-system | grep webhook

# Common issue: Certificate not valid
# Solution: Delete the pod to trigger recreation with new cert
kubectl delete pod -n gatekeeper-system -l gatekeeper=active
```

### Policy Not Enforcing (Audit Mode Not Catching Violations)

```bash
# Verify constraint is active
kubectl get constraint require-resource-limits -o yaml | grep -A5 spec

# Check if constraint has violations
kubectl describe constraint require-resource-limits

# If no violations: policy may be too permissive or not matching resources
# Debug: test policy Rego in isolation
opa test policies/ -v

# Check if your resources match the constraint's match rules
kubectl get deployment -A -o json | jq '.items[0].spec.template.spec.containers'
```

### conftest Showing False Positives

```bash
# Verify policy syntax is correct
conftest verify -p conftest-tests/policy.rego

# Run with verbose output to see which rules are evaluated
conftest test -p conftest-tests/policy.rego conftest-tests/test-manifests.yaml

# Test a single file with debugging
conftest test -p conftest-tests/policy.rego /tmp/deployment.yaml -d

# Compare with Gatekeeper behavior (may differ slightly)
```

### Webhook Timeouts During Deployments

```bash
# Issue: Gatekeeper webhook slow to respond or "context deadline exceeded"
# Symptoms: kubectl apply takes >30 seconds or fails with timeout

# Workaround: Delete the stale webhook (Gatekeeper will recreate it)
kubectl delete validatingwebhookconfiguration gatekeeper-validating-webhook-configuration

# Check webhook logs for slowness (adjust namespace if pods are in flux-system)
kubectl logs -n gatekeeper-system deployment/gatekeeper-audit | grep -i latency

# Solution options:
# 1. Increase webhook timeout in gatekeeper-install.yaml
#    Change: spec.timeoutSeconds from 5 to 10-15
# 2. Exclude non-critical namespaces from validation
# 3. Optimize constraint complexity (fewer rules = faster evaluation)

# Temporarily disable a constraint to test performance
kubectl patch constraint require-resource-limits --type merge \
  -p '{"spec":{"match":{"excludedNamespaces":["default"]}}}'
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start with Audit Mode**: Deploy all policies with `enforcementAction: dryrun` for 2-4 weeks. Never jump directly to enforcement.

2. **Monitor Violations Continuously**: Use compliance dashboards to track violations and identify patterns before enforcing.

3. **Provide Remediation Guidance**: When policies are enforced, teams need clear documentation on:
   - Why the policy exists (security risk, operational stability, etc.)
   - How to fix violations (code examples)
   - Exceptions process (when to request exemptions)

4. **Document Exceptions Carefully**: Use `excludedNamespaces` or `excludedUsers` for legitimate special cases, but require justification.

5. **Test Policies Locally First**: Always validate manifests with conftest in your editor or pre-commit hooks before deployment.

6. **Gradual Rollout**: Enforce policies incrementally, starting with critical ones (security) before operational ones (labeling).

7. **Regular Review**: Quarterly audit of:
   - Which policies have high violation rates (may be too restrictive)
   - Whether exemptions are still justified
   - New policies needed based on incidents

8. **Version Control Policies**: Keep all policy YAML and Rego files in git; use pull requests for policy changes with automated tests.

9. **Test Policy Changes**: Use `.github/workflows/policy-tests.yaml` to validate policy syntax and logic before merging.

10. **Balance Enforcement with Developer Experience**: A policy that everyone exempts is either poorly designed or poorly explained. Iterate based on feedback.
